// HashMap
/**
 * Where vectors store values by an integer index, HashMaps store values by key. It is a hash map implemented with quadratic probing and SIMD lookup. 
 * By default, HashMap uses a hashing algorithm selected to provide resistance against HashDoS attacks.
 * The default hashing algorithm is currently SipHash 1-3, though this is subject to change at any point in the future. 
 * While its performance is very competitive for medium sized keys, other hashing algorithms will outperform it for small keys such as integers as well as 
 * large keys such as long strings, though those algorithms will typically not protect against attacks such as HashDoS.
 * The hash table implementation is a Rust port of Googleâ€™s SwissTable. The original C++ version of SwissTable can be found here, and this CppCon talk gives 
 * an overview of how the algorithm works.
