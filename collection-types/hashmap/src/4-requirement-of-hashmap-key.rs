/**
 * Requirements of HashMap key
 * Any type that implements the Eq and Hash traits can be a key in HashMap. This includes:
 * 
 * bool (though not very useful since there is only two possible keys)
 * int, uint, and all variations thereof
 * String and &str (tips: you can have a HashMap keyed by String and call .get() with an &str)
 * Note that f32 and f64 do not implement Hash, likely because floating-point precision errors would make using them as hashmap keys horribly error-prone.
 * 
 * All collection classes implement Eq and Hash if their contained type also respectively implements Eq and Hash. For example, Vec<T> will implement Hash if Timplements Hash.
