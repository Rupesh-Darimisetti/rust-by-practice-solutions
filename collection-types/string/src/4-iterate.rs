/**
 * UTF-8 & Indexing
 * Strings are always valid UTF-8. This has a few implications:
 * 
 * the first of which is that if you need a non-UTF-8 string, consider OsString. It is similar, but without the UTF-8 constraint.
 * The second implication is that you cannot index into a String
 * Indexing is intended to be a constant-time operation, but UTF-8 encoding does not allow us to do this. 
 * Furthermore, itâ€™s not clear what sort of thing the index should return: a byte, a codepoint, or a grapheme cluster. 
 * The bytes and chars methods return iterators over the first two, respectively.

// 4. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ You can't use index to access a char in a string, but you can use slice &s1[start..end].
