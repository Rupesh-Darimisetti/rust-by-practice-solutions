/**
 * Operator
 * In Rust, many of the operators can be overloaded via traits. 
 * That is, some operators can be used to accomplish different tasks based on their input arguments.
 * This is possible because operators are syntactic sugar for method calls. 
 * For example, the + operator in a + b calls the add method (as in a.add(b)). 
 * This add method is part of the Add trait. 
 * Hence, the + operator can be used by any implementor of the Add trait.

use std::ops;

// Implement fn multiply to make the code work.
// As mentiond above, `+` needs `T` to implement `std::ops::Add` Trait.
// So, what about `*`?  You can find the answer here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ops/
fn multiply<T: std::ops:: Mul<Output = T>>(x:T,y:T) -> T{
    x * y

    assert_eq!(5.0, multiply(1.0, 5.0));

    println!("Success!");
