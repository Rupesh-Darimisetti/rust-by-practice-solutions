# Slices are similar to arrays, but their length is not known at compile time, so you can't use slice directly.
# 1. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Here, both [i32] and str are slice types, but directly using it will cause errors. You have to use the reference of the slice instead: &[i32], &str.
```rs
// Fix the errors, DON'T add new lines!
fn main() {
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    let s1: [i32] = arr[0..2];

    let s2: str = "hello, world" as str;

    println!("Success!");
}
```
# Solution:
```rs
// Fix the errors, DON'T add new lines!
fn main() {
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    let s1: &[i32] = &arr[0..2];

    let s2: &str = "hello, world" as &str;

    println!("Success!");
}
```
# A slice reference is a two-word object, for simplicity reasons, from now on we will use slice instead of slice reference. The first word is a pointer to the data, and the second word is the length of the slice. The word size is the same as usize, determined by the processor architecture, eg 64 bits on an x86-64. Slices can be used to borrow a section of an array, and have the type signature &[T].

```rs
fn main() {
    let arr: [char; 3] = ['ä¸­', 'å›½', 'äºº'];

    let slice = &arr[..2];
    
    // Modify '6' to make it work
    // TIPS: slice( reference ) IS NOT an array, if it is an array, then `assert!` will passed: Each of the two UTF-8 chars 'ä¸­' and 'å›½'  occupies 3 bytes, 2 * 3 = 6
    assert!(std::mem::size_of_val(&slice) == 6);

    println!("Success!");
}
```
