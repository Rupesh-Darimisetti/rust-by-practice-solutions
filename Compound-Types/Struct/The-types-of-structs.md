# 1. ðŸŒŸ We must specify concrete values for each of the fields in struct.
```rs
// Fix the error
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    hobby: String
}
fn main() {
    let age = 30;
    let p = Person {
        name: String::from("sunface"),
        age,
    };

    println!("Success!");
} 
```
# Solution:
```rs
// Fix the error
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    hobby: String
}
fn main() {
    let age = 30;
    let p = Person {
        name: String::from("sunface"),
        age,
        hobby: "coding".to_string()
    };

    println!("Success!");
} 
```
# 2. ðŸŒŸ Unit struct don't have any fields. It can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but donâ€™t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.
```rs
struct Unit;
trait SomeTrait {
    // ...Some behaviors defined here.
}

// We don't care about what fields  are  in the Unit, but we care about its behaviors.
// So we use a struct with no fields and implement some behaviors for it
impl SomeTrait for Unit {  }
fn main() {
    let u = Unit;
    do_something_with_unit(u);

    println!("Success!");
} 

// Fill the blank to make the code work
fn do_something_with_unit(u: __) {   }
```
# Solution:
```rs
struct Unit;
trait SomeTrait {
    // ...Some behaviors defined here.
}

// We don't care about what fields  are  in the Unit, but we care about its behaviors.
// So we use a struct with no fields and implement some behaviors for it
impl SomeTrait for Unit {  }
fn main() {
    let u = Unit;
    do_something_with_unit(u);

    println!("Success!");
} 

// Fill the blank to make the code work
fn do_something_with_unit(u: Unit) {  }
```
# 3. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Tuple struct looks similar to tuples, it has added meaning the struct name provides but has no named fields. It's useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name, but don't care about the fields's names.
```rs
// Fix the error and fill the blanks
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
fn main() {
    let v = Point(__, __, __);
    check_color(v);

    println!("Success!");
}   

fn check_color(p: Color) {
    let (x, _, _) = p;
    assert_eq!(x, 0);
    assert_eq!(p.1, 127);
    assert_eq!(__, 255);
 }
```
# Solution:
```rs
// Fix the error and fill the blanks
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
fn main() {
    let v = Point(0, 127, 255);
    check_color(v);

    println!("Success!");
}   

fn check_color(p: Point) {
    let Point(x, _, _) = p;
    assert_eq!(x, 0);
    assert_eq!(p.1, 127);
    assert_eq!(p.2, 255);
 }
```
